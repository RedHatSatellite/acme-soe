# Ansible Playbook examples

This directory contains some **example** [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks.

You are not expected to  use these as-is, rather you shoud read them, adjust as necessary, and then use them.

Eventually I want replace all puppet parts with ansible.

For a start I'll work on playbooks to do the [bootstrapping steps](https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/soe-ci/#bootstrapping) of a [soe-ci](https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/soe-ci/) setup.
